<h1>Elissa's Past, Present, and Future</h1>

<h2>My Past</h2>

<p>I was born in Japan on February 23rd, 2000. 7 months later, I moved to Greenville South Carolina. When I was 6, my sister Hannah was born, so we moved into a bigger house. 3 years later, my other sister, Karen, was born. I enjoyed school very much. I went to Mt. Zion, then transfered to Oakview in 2nd grade. Then, I went to <a href="https://www.greenville.k12.sc.us/beck/">Beck Academy</a> for middle school. I had NO idea how bad high school would be. If I could go back in time, I would warn myself to NOT take calculus junior year, because it would cause me a lot of sadness and despair.</p>

<p>I go to <a href="https://www.greenville.k12.sc.us/jlmann/">JL Mann High School</a> and am in the 11th grade. I am in some clubs such as Key Club, Mann Nation, MLT, and French Club. My favorite class is Webpage Designs. I enjoy hanging out with my friends, shopping, listening to music, and watching movies in my free time. However, I shouldn't even be doing any of these things. I should be studying for APUSH and calculus, because I am FAILING! Ha ha ha!</p>

<h2>My Future</h2>

<p>In the future, I plan on going to a 4 year college. However, with my grades looking the way they do now, I won't be getting in anywhere! This means, I'm a <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/253871">failure</a>! I would like to live in Greenville, where I've grown up, but I have also thought about living somewhere far away to experience something new. Either way, I'll be homeless because I will fail out of junior year.</p>

<h3>My Future Bucket List</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Not fail high school.</li>
  <li>Get a job.</li>
  <li>Get a house of my own.</li>
  <li>Travel to another country.</li>
  <li>Meet <a href="http://www.shawnmendesofficial.com/">Shawn Mendes</a> again.</li>
</ul>
